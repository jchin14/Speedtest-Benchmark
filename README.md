# Speedtest-Benchmarker
 Python script to automate internet speedtests.
 
 Uni project that exports data to a csv file and gives stats on average results. Could be useful as a way of benchmarking ISP international performance maybe??
 
 First public repo, idk how to GitHub :)

# Instructions:
 To Run 50 Test Benchmark:
 
 Install latest python3 for your OS.
 
 Install the offical Ookla Speedtest CLI client. (On Windows, easiest way is to download the CLI client .exe from https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli and pasting into C:\Windows\System32\speedtest.exe)
 
 Run speedtest_all_servers.py by double clicking on Windows. Idk how to macOS. Possibly `python3 \path\to\speedtest_all_servers.py`
 
 Enter your internet speeds x4.
 
 Enter "no" or hit enter.
 
 Enter "50" servers.
 
 Wait around 20 mins for tests to complete. 
 
 DO NOT open the csv while running as the script will not be able to write data to it. Make a copy of the csv and open the copy if you want a sneak peak.
 
 Have fun and F CVC.
