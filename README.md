# Speedtest-Benchmarker
 Python script to automate internet speedtests.
 
 Uni project that exports data to a csv file and gives stats on average results. Could be useful as a way of benchmarking ISP international performance maybe??
 
 First public repo, idk how to GitHub :)

# Instructions:
 To Run 50 Test Benchmark:
 
 Install latest python3 for your os.
 
 Install the offical Ookla Speedtest CLI client. (On Windows, easiest way is to download the CLI client .exe from https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli and pasting into C:\Windows\System32\speedtest.exe)
 
 Run speedtest_all_servers.py by double clicking on Windows. Idk how to macOS. Possibly `python3 \path\to\speedtest_all_servers.py`
 
 Enter your internet speeds x4.
 
 Enter "no" or hit enter.
 
 Enter "50" servers.
 
 Wait around 20 mins for tests to complete.
