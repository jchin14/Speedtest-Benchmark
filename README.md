# Speedtest-Benchmarker
 Python script to automate internet speedtests.
 
 ISPs hate this one weird script!

 Project that automates speedtests, exports data to a csv and provides stats on average results. Could be useful as a way of benchmarking ISP international performance maybe??
 
 First public repo, idk how to GitHub :)

# Instructions:
 To Run 50 Test Benchmark:
 
 
 Install the offical Ookla Speedtest CLI client. (On Windows, easiest way is to download the CLI client .exe from https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli and pasting into C:\Windows\System32\speedtest.exe)
 
 Download the latest release from https://github.com/jchin14/Speedtest-Benchmarker/releases and unzip

 Run speedtest-benchmarker.exe
 
 Enter your internet speeds x4
 
 Enter "no" or hit enter
 
 Enter "50" servers
 
 Wait around 20 mins for tests to complete

 
 DO NOT open the csv while running as the script will not be able to write data to it. Make a copy of the csv and open the copy if you want a sneaky peak.
 
 Have fun and RIP CVC.
